In this project I'll present an overview on the main characteristics that affect the final price of power boats. In order to have an accurate and proper analysis,
I interviewed Antonio Centis, holder of Nautica Centis. Founded by Bruno Centis in 1974, Nautica Centis has been a nautical workshop specialized in assembling and 
repairing marine engines and generators in boats and power boats. They perform ordinary and extraordinary maintenance of marine engines and systems using only original spare parts.
\nOver the years, Bruno's reliable character led to agreements with important global manufacturers of engines (Man, of which they are a Master workshop, Volvo Penta, and Weber Motor), generators 
(Onan, Kohler), maneuvering propellers (Sleipner), diesel pre-filters (Separ), batteries and battery chargers (Mastervolt), air conditioning systems (Dometic) and control systems (Yachtcontroller).
\nToday the workshop is managed by his son, Antonio, with the help of his family, and supported by all the employees who work every day with commitment and passion to guarantee a comprehensive service 
to customers for the maintenance of their boats.
\nAntonio led my analysis be realistic and suitable with a person who wants to buy a power boat, having the following DataFrame avaiable.

    st.write('''For sure, we know price, category and type of a given boat. Its length, model, location, history and type of fuel are known for the most of the candidates.
    \nIt can be noticed that "Length" is a column of strings: a float number followed by letter "m", which means meter. Therefore it is better to turn it into a float 
    column in order to take advantage of this parameter. Analogously it has been done with columns "Width" and "Depth".
    \nThese parameters are useful in order to choose the right berth and to know where the boat can navigate. In addiction, boats under 10 m length don't have to be declared to the tax authorities in Italy.
     In EU there are limitations on the boat license according to the length of the boat. Thus it's really important for buyer to know these data. Therefore, it's appropriate dropping all the rows that have
     a null entry in column "Width", as they are 63 over 10344. For this aim I used the method notna() to detect valid values in the DataFrame. The resulting DataFrame has 10281 rows. Then I filled the 
     null values of column "Depth" with its mean.

    st.write('''
    One person can be embarked for each linear meter of boat's length: i.e., if the boat is 13.7m long, 13 people can be embarked. Thus we can use the information given by column 
    Length to fill up the missing values of column Cert Number of People. I replaced the null values with the second entry of the tuple returned by the function modf() from the library math, 
    using a for cycle on the indexes of Cert Number of People's null entries. In order to find the latter, I used a boolean mask with the function isnan() from the library numpy.
    We end up with 10281 non-null float values instead of 3597.''')
    st.write('''
    Knowing where the boat is located is an important decisional factor, since transport can be a huge cost. Antonio proposed an example that he saw with his eyes: a boat of 15 m long moved from Naples to Lignano Sabbiadoro
    has cost 10000 â‚¬. Therefore, if you're undecided between two boats but the first is near to you and the second is quite far, you'll choose the first one. The column concerning this parameter gives either
    the Nation and the city or only the first one. Thus, I created a function that returns the first word of a string and modified the original column. This leds the analysis be easier.
